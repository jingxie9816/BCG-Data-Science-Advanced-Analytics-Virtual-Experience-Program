This is a virtual experience program, not a real internship, but I act as a data scientist in BCG GAMMA team to solve business problems for one of their clients.

### The program background is:

Client is a major gas and electricity utility, supplies to corporate, SME(Small & Medium Enterprise) and residential customers.
It faces significant churn problem and most significant in SME segment.

Client's hypothesis: churn is mainly driven by customer price sensitivity.
If it is possible to predict customers likely to churn using a predictive model, client wants to try discounting strategy that offering customers at high propensity to churn a 20% discount.

### My task:
To test whether the hypothesis churn is mainly driven by customer price sensitivity.

### When tackling the business problem, I followed the typical 5 steps as below:

1. Business understanding & problem framing: understanding the context of the customer and the problem theyâ€™re trying to solve with data

2. Exploratory data analysis & data cleaning: understanding the customers data and its statistical properties as well as preparing a dataset for further analysis

3. Feature engineering: using business context and expertise to create new data that may provide useful signals in the prediction of outcomes

4. Modeling and evaluation: Using engineered dataset to model an outcome and to generate predictions. Then, testing these predictions against the ground truth to see whether they are reliable

5. Insights & recommendation: turning the insights of this analysis into business decisions and recommendations
