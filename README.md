# BCG-Data-Science-Advanced-Analytics-Virtual-Experience-Program

This is a virtual experience program, not a real internship, but I act as a data scientist in BCG GAMMA team to solve business problem for one of their clients.

The problem background is that

### When tackling the business problem, I followed the typical 5 steps as below:

1. Business understanding & problem framing: understanding the context of the customer and the problem theyâ€™re trying to solve with data

2. Exploratory data analysis & data cleaning: understanding the customers data and its statistical properties as well as preparing a dataset for further analysis

3. Feature engineering: using business context and expertise to create new data that may provide useful signals in the prediction of outcomes

4. Modeling and evaluation: Using your engineered dataset to model an outcome and to generate predictions. Then,. testing these predictions against the ground truth to see whether they are reliable.

5. Insights & recommendation: turning the insights of this analysis into business decisions and recommendations
